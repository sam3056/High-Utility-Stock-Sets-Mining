# High-Utility-Stock-Sets-Mining

This is a project which utilises high utility mining algorithms along with the sliding window concept to mine high utility stock sets.

This program can be run on any dataset which contains time-series data, 100% desnity data and alternating positive-negative values for the data.

In order to run the code, first clone the repository.

`git clone git@github.com:sam3056/High-Utility-Stock-Sets-Mining.git`

Then in the v2.py file find the read_database function and set the path to the dataset.

Finally, run the code by running the following command and set the value of minimum threshold.

`python v2.py`
